# Hotel_booking_data_analysis

## Business Problem
City Hotel and Resort Hotel have been facing a significant challenge with high rates of booking cancellations. This issue is causing several problems, including reduced revenue and suboptimal use of hotel rooms. The high cancellation rates mean that rooms often remain unoccupied, which directly impacts the hotels' ability to generate revenue efficiently. As a result, the primary objective of both hotels is to reduce these cancellation rates to improve their financial performance and operational efficiency. The goal of this project is to analyze the factors contributing to the high cancellation rates and provide business recommendations to address this issue.

## Key Analyses and Findings
### Cancellation Rate Analysis:

A substantial portion of hotel reservations, 37%, are being cancelled. This has a considerable impact on the hotels' earnings, as these cancellations lead to unoccupied rooms that could have generated revenue.

### Comparison Between City and Resort Hotels:

The analysis revealed that City Hotels have a higher number of bookings compared to Resort Hotels. This might be because resort hotels are generally more expensive, making them less accessible to a broader customer base.

### Price Impact on Cancellations:

It was found that there is a direct correlation between the price of a booking and the likelihood of its cancellation. Higher prices tend to lead to more cancellations, suggesting that price sensitivity plays a significant role in customers' decisions to cancel.

August sees the highest number of both confirmed and cancelled bookings, whereas January has the highest percentage of cancellations. This indicates that certain times of the year are more prone to cancellations, possibly due to seasonal factors.

### Geographical Analysis of Cancellations:

Portugal was identified as the country with the highest number of booking cancellations. This could indicate regional factors influencing cancellation rates, such as local economic conditions or cultural attitudes towards travel.

### Booking Channels:

A large proportion of bookings, 46%, are made through online travel agencies, while only 4% are made directly with the hotels. This suggests that online platforms are the most significant source of bookings but might also contribute to higher cancellation rates due to the ease of cancellation offered by these platforms.

### Occupancy and Revenue Correlation:

When comparing the average daily rate (ADR) with cancellation rates, it was evident that cancellations are more frequent when ADR is high. This reinforces the finding that pricing is a crucial factor in booking cancellations.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides several critical insights that can help City Hotel and Resort Hotel reduce their cancellation rates and improve revenue generation:

### Adjust Pricing Strategies
Since higher prices are linked with more cancellations, the hotels should consider revising their pricing strategies. This could include offering discounts during off-peak seasons or to customers who book directly through the hotel.

### Focus on High-Cancellation Periods
The hotels should pay particular attention to periods like January, where cancellation rates are the highest. Targeted marketing campaigns or promotional offers during these times could help mitigate the impact of cancellations.

### Improve Services in High-Cancellation Regions
In areas like Portugal, where cancellations are particularly high, hotels could enhance their services or offer special deals to encourage guests to follow through with their reservations.

### Optimize Booking Channels
Since a significant number of cancellations come from online travel agencies, hotels might consider offering incentives for direct bookings, which typically have lower cancellation rates.
